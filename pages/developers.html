		<p>
		NFsim is an open source project and we encourage you to take the time to learn 
		the code and make your own improvements, tweaks, and adjustments.  While we cannot 
		guarantee support, feel free to send us technical questions or specific
		coding requests through the <a href="feedback.php">feedback </a>page. </p>
		
		
		<p>The source code is packaged with the full distribution of NFsim, and this is the best way to begin development.  
		You can develop, compile, build and test the code in any environment you want, but we strongly suggest you consider 
		using Eclipse (<a href="http://www.eclipse.org">http://www.eclipse.org</a>) as your IDE.  Eclipse is an excellent and free development environment.  
		It was originally designed for Java, but it works great for C/C++ and has plug-in support for many other languages 
		(including a nice XML viewer).  NFsim was originally developed in Eclipse, and you'll notice that all the makefiles
		in the 'bin' directory have been automatically generated using Eclipse.  To use Eclipse with NFsim, you will need 
		the CDT set of plugins for Eclipse (<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/cdt">http://www.eclipse.org/cdt</a>).  The instructions for downloading and installing
		Eclipse and setting up a project in Eclipse from existing source code can be found on their website.</p>
		
		
		<p>The best way to familiarize yourself with the code is to begin with the simple system example 
		(located in the src/NFtest/simple_system directory).  This file is heavily documented and will allow you 
		to hard code your own model and show you the basic data structures and utilities that exist in NFsim.  
		Try building your own system, and as you do, begin learning the basic data structures and functionality of 
		the classes in the src/NFcore directory.  Finally, once you begin to work with the code, you will find it 
		useful to have the <a href="support/devDoc/NFsimDoc.html">technical source code documentation</a>.</p>

		<p>And if you do happen to create the next amazing simulator with unheard of capabilities using our code base, 
		please let us know!  We will definitely be interested and we'll want to talk!</p>

				NFsim's algorithms and data structures were designed so that
				the effeciency of standard simulations depends only on the number of
				events - not the size of the reaction network.  That means
				that no matter how large aggregates or clusters become in your model,
				NFsim's performance will not suffer.  Now you can simulate
				clustering and aggregate formation in well-mixed volumes
				exactly and effeciently.

			<div class="performanceTextDiv">
				NFsim's performance does not depend on the number of agents in
				the system because molecule reads run in constant time.  That means
				you can put as many molecules as your computer's memory can support.
				Combined with the fact that molecules in large concentrations (like ATP
				or sugars) can be incorporated into simple reactions as state changes
				or through functionally defined rate laws (thus requiring no extra
				memory costs), your system can be as large
				as you need it.

			<div class="performanceTextDiv">
				NFsim's algorithm is event-driven and produces exact stochastic

				platform for simulating systems with a high state space, NFsim is much
				faster because it does not involve a significant number of null events.
