Models are specified in \r\nthe BioNetGen Langauge, providing a powerful model building environment.\r\n\r\nIf you just want to download and use NFsim, you should simply download a preconfigured\r\npackaged release from http://emonet.biology.yale.edu/nfsim.

This feature is useful for reducing memory\r\n        requirements when a simple molecule has very large population. A molecule\r\n        type may be flagged for treatment as a population variable by using the\r\n        \"population\" keyword following the molecule type definition in the BNGL\r\n        model file. See section 8.i in the documentation for further detail.\r\n        (b) Added a new Reaction Class called \"FunctionProduct\" that permits local\r\n        functions defined on two reactants. The local rate law must have the form\r\n        f(x)*g(y), where x and y are tags on two distinct reactants. See section\r\n        7.c in the documentation for complete information.\r\n        (c) Fixed some problems evaluating complex-scoped local functions (CSLF). \r\n        CSLF were not updated properly after reactions that split complexes or \r\n        deleted molecules. As in v1.10, complex-scoped local functions are\r\n        enabled by default. A new command-line switch, -nocslf, has been added\r\n        which disables complex-scoped evaluation. \r\n        (d) Improved efficiency for matching patterns with connected-to syntax\r\n        when the connected-to component does not have reaction center. This may\r\n        be especially notable in models with large complexes, e.g. polymerization.\r\n\t\t\r\nv1.10   Aug, 2011\r\n        (a) Command line parser now detects arguments that are not properly\r\n        preceeded by a dash, and generates a warning.  (b) Includes a check when \r\n        creating template molecules that throws an error when users attempt to \r\n        use Null or Trash in reactant or observable patterns (anything that \r\n        requires the creation of a Template molecule). (c) fixed a bug introduced \r\n        in v1.09 whereby a site was allowed to bind to itself, for instance, in a \r\n        dimerization rxn.  (d) Support for creating a new molecule bound to an\r\n        existing molecule, as in a rule like A(a) -> A(a!1).A(a!1). Existing code\r\n        that implemented this feature did not function properly with the check\r\n        for null conditions before reactions were fired. (e) Fixed bug in template \r\n        molecule when clearing molecules after a connected-to syntax search.  In \r\n        some cases, not all molecules were being cleared, giving rise to situations \r\n        where adding one observable created dangling matches which affected the \r\n        results of other observables. (f) NFsim is now packaged with Network3, an\r\n        updated version of the run_network code to execute ODE and SSA simulations.\r\n        Network3 allows global functions in BNGL models among other release features\r\n        given here: http://bionetgen.org/index.php/Release_Notes.  Note that Network3\r\n        does not support On-The-Fly Stochastic Simulation (you will have to recompile\r\n        Network2 to use this feature).  (g)  Mac 32bit is no longer supported by NFsim,\r\n        but you can make executables for older Macs by recompiling the code on your\r\n        own machine.  See the manual for instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\nv1.09   Apr, 2011\r\n        (a) NFsim now allows the mixing of integers and strings as component\r\n        labels, although if numbers and strings are mixed, all labels are parsed\r\n        as strings, NOT integers.  Therefore, PLUS and MINUS keywords cannot\r\n        be used if mixing integer states and string states, and a warning will\r\n        be generated if a state is set to PLUS.  One can only use PLUS or MINUS\r\n        when ALL states are an integer value greater than zero.  This new behavior\r\n        was needed to handle BNGL files that used the convention of ~P specifying\r\n        phosphorylated, and ~0 specifying unphosphorylated.\r\n        (b) Fixed bug whereby if verbose option was turned on without specifying\r\n        an output file location, no output would be generated.  Now, output to\r\n        a gdat file will be generated in these cases.\r\n        (c) Use of 'ss' input argument to 'saveSpecies', which prints a a list of \r\n        all species at the end of a simulation, is now handled.  This feature was \r\n        implemented to allow future support in BNG by restarting an NFsim simulation \r\n        after it ends, which can be done by parsing the output species list together \r\n        with a BNGL model file.  This feature still has to be tested in BNG, and will\r\n        likely be fully documented in v1.10.  The 'ss' flag writes the file to either\r\n        [system_name]_nf.species, or a file designated by the user.\r\n        (d) fixed memory leak in TemplateMolecules that caused memory / performance\r\n        issues with molecules having multiple identical sites and a high degree\r\n        of aggregation. (e) fixed csv error, where when the csv flag is used, the\r\n        header line is not comma delimited.  (f)  nfsim now supports intra-molecular\r\n        binding.  Previously these events were rejected as null events.\r\n\r\n\r\nv1.08   Dec, 2010 - With the new TotalRate keyword, users are now able to\r\n        specify whether or not to use the microscopic (default) interpretation\r\n        or macroscopic (TotalRate) interpretation of rate laws.  Now, NFsim\r\n        convention matches BNG.  Previously, NFsim interpreted all rates as\r\n        microscopic except for global functions, which were interpreted as\r\n        macroscopic.  This is now also explained in the user manual.  Example\r\n        models for the flagellar motor and oscillating gene expression have\r\n        been updated correspondingly so that they still produce the same results\r\n        as in the NFsim paper.\r\n        \r\n        Users also now have the option of outputting gdat files in a comma \r\n        delimited format (csv), which makes parsing the output file easier \r\n        in some circumstances, using the flag \"-csv\".  Additionally, a bug in\r\n        the parameter scanning script was fixed that caused the script to\r\n        crash when scanning a model that includes the local function syntax. \r\n\r\n\r\nv1.07   Nov, 2010 - A series of updates to the code were made in this\r\n        release.  (1) RNF files that are not found produce an error message.\r\n        Previously, no error message was given and execution proceeded as if\r\n        the RNF flag was not given.  (2) Input flags to NFsim can be given\r\n        in the original format with a single dash (as in ./NFsim -logo), or\r\n        with the more \"linuxy\" style double dash (as in ./NFsim --logo).\r\n        (3) The parameter scan script had problems when parsing BNGL files\r\n        with local functions due to the '%' character.  This is now fixed.\r\n        (4) The universal traversal limit is automatically set to be the size\r\n        of the largest pattern in the system, which can be overridden by\r\n        passing the -utl flag.  This allows users who are unfamiliar with\r\n        this speedup to still take advantage of it to a certain extent.  (5)\r\n        the -rtag flag was added that allows NFsim to produce output whenever\r\n        a particular reaction, given by the -rtag flag, is given.  This allows,\r\n        for instance, users to track the fates of single particles exactly\r\n        without using the comprehensive molecule output feature.  (6) The above\r\n        changes are documented in an updated user manual.\r\n\r\n\r\nv1.06   Sept 28, 2010 - added scripts for running NFsim from Matlab, parameter\r\n        scanning, and basic parameter estimation.  The manual is also updated\r\n        to reflect these changes.  However, the precompiled executables of NFsim\r\n        remain unchanged from v1.05, so running them will give the old version \r\n        number unless you recompile the code on your own computer.  Also, models\r\n        that were used to compare the performance of NFsim to DYNSTOC, RuleMonkey,\r\n        and Kappa are now included with a readme file under: \r\n        models/performance_test_models.\r\n\r\nv1.052  First publicly released stable build\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
