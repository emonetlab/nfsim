				Many proteins can be phosphorylated and dephosphorylated at multiple sites to control their function, but simulating
				the reaction dynamics of molecules with more than just two or three sites is challenging.  NFsim can effeciently
				simulate proteins with as many sites as you want to consider, which we demonstrate with a suite of example models.

				<div class="exampleModelTextDiv">
				a.k.a., Trivalent Ligand, Bivalent Receptor (TLBR) system.  This classic model system has been used
				to understand how immune system receptors aggregate when they are crosslinked
				by mutual binding to the same ligand or antigen.  Aggregation of receptors can eventually activate downstream signaling, so
				the dynamics of aggregation are important to understand.  Due to the complexity
				of aggregation, very few biochemical simulators available today can handle this system.  NFsim is one of them, and can
				do it rather effeciently.

				<div class="exampleModelDiv">Assistance Neighborhood model of bacterial chemoreceptor signaling</div>
				<div class="exampleModelTextDiv">
				Bacteria can sense and swim towards food using thier chemotaxis sensory system together with flagella.  The receptors
				that sense food can assemble into highly cooperative clusters that can amplify weak signals by switching between on and off states.  
				To simulate the details of receptor activity, you need to introduce a functional expression for the coopeartivity that can be applied
				to the receptor clusters.  Researchers have built custom simulators that can do this (and only this), but NFsim is the only
				general biochemical reaction simulator that solves this problem and can simulate cooperative receptor activity.

				<div class="exampleModelTextDiv">
				Many large molecular structures are complicated and not well understood, but modelers can often approximate their function with a
				simple equation, such as a Hill function.  NFsim allows you to do write any mathetical function you like and use it directly in
				your model to control the rate of a reaction rule.  For example,
				you can write a funciton that captures the dynamic switching behavior of the bacterial flagellar motor.  This allows modelers
				to quickly connect coarse-grained representations of complex behavior, such as the motor, to the rest of your biochemical reactions.

				<div class="exampleModelDiv">Fc&epsilon;-RI receptor signaling in the immune system</div>
				<div class="exampleModelTextDiv">
				Large signaling pathways, such as Fc&epsilon;-RI signaling in immune cells, can involve hundreds of different 
				molecules that can interact, aggregate, and modify each other.  Standard simulators force the modeler to consider all
				distinct chemical species, so modelers generally have to make simplifications.  In NFsim, models never have to enumerate
				or generate the list of all chemical species, so you can simulate systems like Fc&epsilon;-RI in detail.
